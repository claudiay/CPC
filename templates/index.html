	<p>Companion planting is the planting of different crops in proximity (in gardening and agriculture), on the theory that they assist each other in nutrient uptake, pest control, pollination, and other factors necessary to increasing crop productivity. Companion planting is a form of polyculture.	
	<p>This is a three step process,
	<ol>
	<li>Enter your plot  dimensions.
	<li>Select how many squares of each plant you want.
	<li>Generate your planting guide and print out the pdf to use in your garden.
